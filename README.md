Flashprint is free 3D printing software that enables you to process the 3D models created so that they can later be produced using a 3D printer.

These are exported as G-Code and transferred to the 3D printer via USB cable, SD card or Wi-Fi and then the component is printed.

But the problem is that there is no installer for the Linux distribution openSUSE Leap or Tumbleweed for this software, for example, but only for Windows, macOS and Debian-based Linux distributions!

So that it's still possible to use this program on other Linux distributions, then I have created an installation script that will solve this problem in the future.
